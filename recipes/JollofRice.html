    <h2>Recipe Details</h2>
    <p>We will use this space to share how we cook Greek Chicken Kabobs</p>
    <p>This bold-flavored jollof rice, my version of the dish served all over West Africa, will go well with any spicy chicken, meat, or fish.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 red bell peppers, seeded and cut into chunks</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 habanero pepper, seeded</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chicken stock</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place bell peppers, tomatoes, habanero pepper, garlic, and 1/4 cup stock in a blender or food processor; blend until smooth. The consistency will be similar to a thick marinara sauce. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat oil over medium heat. Add diced onion and fry until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add tomato paste and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Add rice and cook for about 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
